Apple: 20

Orange: 10

Banana: 15

JSON in JavaScript example is best. Here it is partially, to help start you off.

var fruit = [

	{name:"Apple", quantity:20, color:"red"},
	{name:"Orange", quantity:10, color:"orange"}

];

Using Javascript/Canvas, draw out a bar chart showing the quantity in sales for the fruit. Each bar must be in a color that matches the fruit, please choose a unique color for each fruit.

Write the name of the fruit, followed by the bar chart. You can choose horizontal or vertical.
