Notes: This lab wasn't hard but I think the intended purpose is impossible to accomplish.

The notes are to be SAVED ON INPUT, so any change is immediately saved. 
However, the undo simply loads that saved input, causing no change to occur.
If the task called for THREE buttons, one to save, clear and undo, then one could load a specific set of notes and update the notes to be
saved.

Task:
You might have to save the file to a server rather than running from localhost for this page to get localStorage to work.

    Have a simple form for the the user to store their notes.
        Create an input box (of 40 characters) to allow the user to title their notes
        Create a textarea (10 rows, 80 columns) ) to let the user write some text.
        As the user is writing the text (onInput) save the text value to the localStorage.
    If the user comes back to the page, restore the text back in the form, so that the user can resume their information.
    Offer 2 buttons, one called Clear, and one called Undo.
        Clear erases the text in the whole form and therefore in the localStorage.
        Undo will restore the form to the previous values.
            It would make sense to save a previous copy of the values of the localStorage into some variables as backup.
                Think about what happens if the user presses Undo more than once, what should happen, it should hopefully toggle back/forth           between the last two changes.
