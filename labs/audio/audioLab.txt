Note: I was stumped for the longest before I realized I was missing the </script> tag. Wasn't difficult at all. 
And since normal buttons were allowed, that's what I went with.

Task: Use the following site to help you with this lab.

Have 5 buttons (or more) to make a music/sound effect machine. Have a series of buttons that are labeled. They should play a sound when clicked.

Try to make a box or something hold the buttons, so to looks like a sound machine. You are welcomed to use an Image Map tool to place links on an image (of a sound machine) if you want it to look more realistic. Here is how Images Maps work. Even use Cool Text to make fancy text if you like. But using plain buttons is fine.
